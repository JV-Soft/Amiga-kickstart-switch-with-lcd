# Amiga-kickstart-switch-with-lcd

This kit consists of several parts and can work in different configurations.

This kit is intended for installation on all versions and revisions of the Amiga, but for simplicity I will describe an example of use on the Amiga A1200

The kit consists of a main control board on an STM32 microcontroller, this board has an LCD screen, two control buttons and an encoder for controlling the Gotek floppy disk drive emulator 
The second board, which is installed instead of two standard Kickstart microcircuits, contains 4 ROMs
The third board is an IDE adapter into which they are installed two IDE-SD adapters, for SD cards you can switch boot between two different OS
The fourth board is a small board for connecting to Gotek.
